# Start your own "Can of Books" App

This repository has starter code to begin work on creating your own online bookshelf.

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

## Use this template

Clone this repo to your own account with the green "Use this template" button. Then, add any collaborators. Now you are ready to start adding features! Deploy your site to let the world know which books have had the greatest impact on you, and what's recommended. Enjoy!

## Project Name

**Author**: David Waiganjo
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This is an app that use Auth0 to log in a user and allow them to access resources on the site. Resource include books that have been persisted using NoSQL database. the user can also add a new book/s and also delete books within their accounts. The app also allows users to update books on the database.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Building this app requires reading Auth0 docs and having the necessarly technology to write react app

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

Technologies used for this app include React , JavaScript. Libraries include axios, react-bootstrap and Auth0

## Change Log

<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

At 8/15/2021 08:am The application allows users to use Auth0 and view information contained in the page.
At 8/18/2021 10:00pm The application allow user to view books that have been persisted by MongoDB
At 8/22/2021 12:00pm The application allows the user to add and delete books from their account
At 8/25/2021 08:07pm The application allows the user to update books in the databse
